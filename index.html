          <h2>LIFE</h2>
          <h4>&nbsp; Nectarios of Aegina (Greek: Άγιος Νεκτάριος Αιγίνης), born
            Anastasios Kephalas (Greek: Αναστάσιος Κεφαλάς) was the Metropolitan of Pentapolis.
            He was on 1 October 1846 in Selymbria (today Silivri, Istanbul) in the Ottoman Empire to a poor family.
            His parents, Dimos and Maria Kephalas, were pious Christians.<br><br>
            &nbsp; At the age of 14, he moved to Constantinople (Istanbul) to work and
            further his education. In 1866, at age 20, he moved to the island of Chios
            to take a teaching post. On November 7, 1876, he became a monk, at age 30,
            in the Monastery of Nea Moni, for he had long wished to embrace the ascetic life.<br><br>
            &nbsp;Three years after becoming a monk he was ordained a deacon, taking the name Nectarios.
            He graduated from the University of Athens in 1885. During his years as a
            student of the University of Athens he wrote many books, pamphlets, and
            Bible commentaries.<br><br>
            &nbsp; Following his graduation he went to Alexandria, Egypt,
            where he was ordained a priest and served the Church of Saint Nicholas
            in Cairo. He was consecrated Metropolitan bishop of Pentapolis (an
            ancient diocese in Cyrenaica, in what is now Libya) by the Greek Orthodox
            Patriarch Sophronios in 1889.<br><br>
            &nbsp; He served as a bishop in Cairo for one year. Nectarios was very popular
            with the people, which gave rise to jealousy among his colleagues.
            They were able to persuade his superior that Nectarios had ambitions to
            displace the Patriarch. Nectarios was suspended from his post without
            explanation. He then returned to Greece in 1891, and spent several years
            as a preacher (1891–1894). He was then director of the Rizarios Ecclesiastical
            School for the education of priests in Athens for fifteen years.
            He developed many courses of study, and wrote numerous books, while preaching
            widely throughout Athens.</h4>

          </div>
          <h4>&nbsp;In 1904, at the request of several nuns, he established
            Holy Trinity Monastery for them on the island of Aegina. In December 1908,
            at the age of 62, Nectarios resigned from his post as
            school director and withdrew to the Holy Trinity Convent on Aegina,
            where he lived out the rest of his life as a monk. He wrote, published,
            preached, and heard confessions. He also tended the gardens, carried
            stones, and helped with the construction of the monastery buildings that
            were built with his own funds.<br><br>
            &nbsp; Nectarios died on November 8, 1920, at the age of 74,
            following hospitalization for prostate cancer and two months of
            treatment. His body was taken to the Holy Trinity Convent, where
            he was buried by his best friend Saint Savvas of Kalymnos, who later
            painted the first icon of Nectarios.
            The funeral of Nectarios was attended by multitudes of people from
            all parts of Greece and Egypt. The relics of Nectarios were removed from
            the grave on 2 September 1953.<br><br>
            &nbsp; He was officially recognized as a saint by the Ecumenical
            Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1961. His feast day is celebrated
            every year on 9 November. He was also known as the Miracle Worker of Aegina.
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Among the songs sung on November 9 in his memory, which the Orthodox Church dedicated to Saint
            Nectarios, is the troparion (a short hymn or an apolytikion) in the First Tone, that speaks briefly about
            the saint's life.<br><br>
            &nbsp; O faithful, let us honor Nectarios, divine servant of Christ, offspring of Silivria and guardian of
            Aegina,
            who in these latter years was manifested as the true friend of virtue. All manner of healing wells forth for
            those who in piety cry out, "Glory to Christ who glorified you; glory to Him who, through you, wrought
            wonders; glory to Him who, through you, works healing for all."
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; A major film production, starring well-known foreign and Greek actors and actresses, will mark
            the 100th anniversary of the falling asleep in the Lord of Saint Nectarios, the most popular Saint of the
            Orthodox Church. The title of the film is "Man of God" and it will officially premiere in November 2020.
            It is about the biography of Saint Nectarios.

          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">Quick healing at the Holy Relics of Saint Nectarios</h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Among the miracles performed by Saint Nectarios is the miracle that the saint performed
            with me. That is why, I will tell you how this miracle happened!<br><br>
            &nbsp; It was in June 2012 when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my right abdomen.
            Initially I thought it would be a temporary pain due to effort and it would go away on its own.
            That's why I tried some natural remedies but I didn't get rid of the pain but it got worse.
            Then I thought it might be a hernia but I didn't want to have surgery in any form.
            So I prayed to Saint Nectarios to help me go to Bucharest to pray at the coffin with his
            Holy Relics and anoint me with holy oil.
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; The night before leaving I was visiting a friend and when I left I could not get up
            from the couch. Then I thought that the next day I will have to go directly
            to the operation because it is impossible to get to Bucharest by personal car.
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; The next morning on June 9, 2012, I decided to go to Bucharest with my wife and
            children. I managed to cover well over 300 kilometers and then to walk by subway and walk
            a few hundred meters but with great weight.
            Because I arrived in the afternoon, I didn't find many people in the
            church anymore and I got on my knees and quietly read the akathist of Saint Nectarios.
            But even as I was reading towards the end of the prayer, I felt some fine movements in
            my abdomen after which I felt better. Then I got up, kissed the holy relics,
            and anointed myself with oil from the saint's candle, and in short I felt no pain.
            I was no longer bothered by the belt of my pants, or the unevenness of
            the road, nothing.
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; I left home with the certainty that I will not make the journey in vain and
            that I will be healed and that my wish was fulfilled by a miracle of
            Saint Doctor Nectarios without costing me money and without being subjected
            to surgical torment.
            And although it was over 30 degrees Celsius outside, I felt an inner
            peace and well-being that I got home safely without feeling any pain.
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; I related this miracle so that other people who need help know,
            to pray with confidence to Saint Nectarios because the saint can help them
            and will not overlook anyone who will pray with hope that he will receive
            his help.</h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Saint Nectarios, thank you very much for the help you have given me!
          </h4><br>

          <h4>&nbsp; Saint Metropolitan Nectarios of Pentapolis is one of the greatest theologians of the early
            twentieth century, with an exceptional level of academic training and a holy zeal for preaching from
            an early age. He wrote numerous works of significance and consistency that justify him with the
            words "you were crowned among the Holy Fathers". Thus in Greece the following works were published:
            "Historical Study on the Causes of Schism" (princeps 1911 edition, in 2 volumes); "Orthodox
            Catechism" (Athens 1899 princeps edition); "On the Immortality of the Soul and on the Holy
            Remembrances" (Athens, 1901); "The Ecumenical Synods of the Church of Christ. A Study of the Holy
            Icons" (reprinted at Thessaloniki in 1972), "Psaltirion" in lyrical meter and with explanatory notes
            (Athens, 1908); "Theotokarion - songs and hymns dedicated to the Most Holy Mother of God, Eternal
            Virgin Mary" (1907, Athens), published in at least 6 editions; "Christian Morality Courses for
            Students of the Rizareion School" (last edition in 1992 in Athens); "Know yourself"; "On the Holy
            Sacraments"; "Christology ..." "History of the Gospel"; "Historical Study of the Honest Cross"; "On

          <h4>&nbsp; Here are a few teachings from the books of Saint Nectarios:

          </h4><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">The face of the believer in Christ
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; How beautiful it is the face of the believer! How wonderful is grace his face! The beauty
            his charms you, and his height gives the measure the confidence he has the believer in God.
            The goodness painted on the believer's face testifies to his undisturbed conscience. Goodness
            painted on the face of the believer confesses about his conscience undisturbed.
            The believer has the appearance of a man freed from the tyranny of worries of life, those
            burdensome of the spirit and at the same time the appearance of a man whose confidence in God
            appears painted in vivid colors on the features of his face.
            The believer has the appearance of a completely happy man, because he is entrusted with the
            divinity of his faith and believes in the truth faith.
            God spoke to the believer secretly in his heart.
            His voice filled her heart and but divine happiness overflowed.
            The heart and mind are given to God. His love warms his heart and the spirit of the believer hurry
            up to the Lord.
            Delight is for him the search for the works of God and delight is contemplating the beauty of the
            building that fills his soul.
          </h4><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">The face of the unbeliever
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; The unbeliever is the most unhappy of men, for he is deprived of the only earthly
            goodness, which is faith, his only guide to truth and happiness. The unbeliever is the most
            unhappy because he is hopeless, his only support and staff that helps him cross the long road of
            life. He is unhappy because he has no love for people and because he lacks the beauty of the icon
            of the Creator, which faith reveals. Unfortunately, after a torturous struggle with life, he heads
            wearily, hopeless and fearful to the end and to the grave that awaits him openly.
          </h4><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">About consciousness
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Consciousness is the objective judge of human deeds. Consciousness always speaks
            about good deeds and about the bad ones. It upholds the truth, honors virtue, praises wisdom and
            he recognizes as good and pleasing to God the works of the law. Consciousness calms down when man
            obeys the law morality, while when he violates it he is disturbed.
          </h4><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">About faith
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Faith! Divine gift, fruit of divine revelation, knowledge of mysteries, heavenly
            wisdom, teacher of heavenly truths, ladder that unites heaven and earth, the connection between God
            and
            men, the proof of divine friendship and love, the spread of heavenly goodness! In what words
            should I speak of your power and your works? Your power is truly divine, your work infinite. You
            are the light that illuminates the dark-minded. You lead those who seek the truth in the
            Scriptures and become a sure guide to knowledge. You warm hearts with divine love. You give true
            hope and secretly guide people. You clothe with royal robes those who have received your light.
            Faith is the eye of the soul. Through faith the soul sees and investigates the unseen and hidden
            from it.
          </h4><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">Worldly delight
          </h4>
          <h4>&nbsp; Delight in worldly goodness brings well-being fatigue, fatigue brings disgust, disgust
            rejection, rejection boredom (mood produced by lack of interest), boredom upset, anger brings pain,
            pain despair and despair leads to suicide.
            The delights of the world are powerless to fill the void of the heart.
            The pleasures and pleasures of the world passing, leave in the heart only bitterness, set like a
            leaven, and the temporary imaginations are sisters of troubles and sufferings.
          </h4><br>
          <h3>POEMS</h3>
          <h4>&nbsp; Throughout the period of his episcopacy, Saint Nectarios spent much time in prayer and
            contemplation, and dedicated himself to the monastic life. His spiritual lifestyle, and his
            particular dedication to the Virgin Mary inspired him to write a wide variety of religious poetry,
            much of which was published during his life, and after his repose in 1920.
            One of the many poems he wrote is "Agni Parthene" (Greek: Ἁγνὴ Παρθένε) or "O Virgin Pure".
            According to a tradition passed down on the island of Aegina, St. Nectarios reportedly composed
            the text for this poem after having seen a vision of the Theotokos in a dream where she asked him
            to record this poem. The original script can still be viewed on his prayer table in his bedroom
            at this monastery.
            It was later published as a poetic hymn for non-liturgical use and private edification in his
            publication called "Theotokarion of Odes & Hymns for the Most-Holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary"
            (Θεοτοκάριον, ἤτοι προσευχητάριον μικρόν) of 1905, which included many other similar poems.

          <h2>PILGRIMAGE</h2>
          <h4>&nbsp; If you want to go on a pilgrimage to the monastery built by St. Hierarch Nectarius on the
            island of Aegina you must arrive in Athens (Greece). From there you go by bus, subway or taxi to
            Dana 8 in the port of Piraeus, from where you take a ferry to Aegina (approximately cost 15 euros
            round trip). The ferry travels this route in about 1 hour. From the port of Aegina take the bus or
            taxi to the Monastery of St. Nectarios.
